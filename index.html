      <h1>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</h1>
      <p>
        VLTIF, the Visible Light Thermal Imaging Fusion system is an 
	application designed to detect and count vehicles in traffic
	video sequences using a fusion between thermal_imaging and standard 
	visible light spectrum cameras. Vehicle detection is an active and 
	relevant research topic in computer vision and image processing. It 
	is an essential ingredient in many traffic fields as much research has 
	been focused on the optimization of traffic lights, enforcement of 
	intersections, effectiveness of traffic reduction measures, and 
	other traffic topics which rely on empirical evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
	Current vehicle detection techniques rely on standard visible light 
	spectrum cameras only and have shown weaknesses in their detection 
	accuracy. Whereas visible light cameras are sensitive to issues such 
	as the time of day and reflection from surfaces, fusing thermal imaging 
	should greatly improve the robustness and performance over standard 
	visible-color only systems.
      </p>
      <p>
	Our system will be stand-alone application which will take synchronized 
	thermal imaging video and visible light video as input and will output 
	the results of the traffic detection system. The detection results will 
	include a labeled video showing detected traffic as well as a formatted 
	file denoting detection times and locations. This is useful for validation 
	as well as further processing by other systems. It will enable the user to
	open a video and label traffic lanes as lines. This will allow the
	system not only to count cars, but to organize them by traffic lanes.
       <p>
       </p>
	Our system will include a gui which will enable the
	user to select relevant parameters as well as begin processing of video. 
	The user will first select a video file to process. One major component 
	is to allow the user to draw the traffic lanes onto the video display.  
	By selecting the locations of traffic lanes, users will be allowed to count,
	segment, and track traffic flow in individual lanes.  Once the lanes are 
	established, the user will then begin processing. 
       </p>
       <p>
	The goal of our system is to reduce the complexity of traffic segmentation  
	as much as possible. The user should have very little interaction with the
	system except to choose traffic lanes and begin processing.  By reducing the
	complexity of our system into a ``black box'', we reduce the training time for
	novice users as well as reduce the likelihood for errors which occur from 
	inappropriate configuration. This will require algorithms and techniques 
	which are robust and light on variables. We have identified several techniques
	which will serve as a starting point to segmentation and classification. These
	techniques include mog, baysian classifier, and markov models.
	Our techniques will also require developing techniques for fusing fundamentally 
	different imaging techniques.
